# Mercedes-Benz

- **Role:** Front-end developer

This project was a collaboration between Mercedes-Benz and Monocle to promote a new self-driving car, the Mercedes-Benz S 500. This fully responsive website uses HTML5, CSS3/Less and Salvattore for the grid system. It was also the first test in production for a small tool I'd created for re-croping images based on viewport width, aiming to eliminate problems such as landscape images looking too tall on a phone screen.
