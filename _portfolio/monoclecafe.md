# The Monocle Cafe

- **Role:** Front-end developer
- **URL:** [http://bouc.as/monocle-cafe](http://bouc.as/monocle-cafe)

This was the first project I've worked on at Monocle. Beautiful photography of tasty products, a subtle parallax effect, gorgeous typography and a bold approach to a combination of vertical and horizontal scrolling made this website generate quite a buzz on social media. Makes me hungry every time.
