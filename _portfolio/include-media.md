This is not so much about a website, but about the project it represents. *include-media* is an open-source Sass library for managing breakpoints and writing CSS media queries that I've developed after doing an intensive research on the existing solutions. The whole process was documented in an article I wrote on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/approaches-media-queries-sass/) and the technical intricaes were discussed in an article on [David Walsh's blog](http://davidwalsh.name/sass-media-query).
