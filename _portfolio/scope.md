# Scope

- **Role:** Full-stack developer
- **URL:** [http://bouc.as/scope-community](http://bouc.as/scope-community)

Scope is the UK's leading disability charity, helping to make the country a better place for disabled people since 1951. Its online community is a forum where people can ask for help and advice from Scope's helpline, share concerns and experiences with others and browse a list of tips from other people with disabilities and their families.

The website required intensive research and special attention to accessiblity, as it was audited by an independent accessibility auditor. I was responsible for adding new features and improving existing ones, both on front-end and back-end, working closely with the client in a true Agile project.
