# Lazy Boy

- **Role:** Full-stack developer
- **URL:** [http://bouc.as/lazy-boy](http://bouc.as/lazy-boy)

I think I'm just keeping this one here for emotional reasons. Lazy Boy is my musical alter ego and this is the website I designed to mark the release of my first (and only) record as a singer-songwriter. I was the only developer — and designer — working on the project, so it involved everything from the drawings in Photoshop, that match the atmosphere set by the album artwork, to the front-end build and the back-end structure that consumes the data from a Tumblr site.

Due to the unique nature of this design, it's not exactly mobile-friendly. The plan was to develop a different version of the site for mobile devices, but due to limitations set by professional commitments and the space-time continuum itself, it never happened.
