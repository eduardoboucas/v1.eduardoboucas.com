# Canon

- **Role:** Lead Developer
- **URL:** [http://bouc.as/canon-hub](http://bouc.as/canon-hub)

My first project as Lead Developer for Time Inc was this content hub for Canon across 5 magazine brands (Trusted Reviews, What Digital Camera, Amateur Photographer, Marie Claire and Good to Know). The campaign promoted a diffent camera for each brand and featured a multimedia gallery and a competition.

The front-end was built in HTML5 and Sass/CSS3 and a Symfony installation gets the content from an in-house CMS.
