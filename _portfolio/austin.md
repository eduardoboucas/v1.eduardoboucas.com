# Austin, Texas

- **Role:** Lead Developer

To celebrate the collaboration between [NME](http://nme.com) and the city of Austin, this website for music lovers aggregates photo galleries and videos, giving a special focus to the annual NME Awards show that takes place in London. 

A fully responsive website, built in HTML5, CSS3 with Sass, powered by a PHP/Symfony installation. As a music lover myself, this project was a delight to work on. Come on, the hero section consists of a quote by Dave Grohl!
